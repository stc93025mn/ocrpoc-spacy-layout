## Development Workflow

### Branching Strategy

- `main`: Stable production code
- `feature/*`: New features (e.g., `feature/add-table-extraction`)
- `bugfix/*`: Bug fixes
- `hotfix/*`: Critical fixes for production

### Making Changes

1. Create a feature branch:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes following our coding standards

3. Write tests for new functionality

4. Run the full test suite:

   ```bash
   pytest --cov
   black .
   flake8
   bandit -r src/
   ```

5. Commit your changes:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add your feature description"
   ```

6. Push and create a pull request

### Commit Messages
