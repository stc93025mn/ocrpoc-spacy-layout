## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Git
- Virtual environment tools

### Development Setup

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ocrpoc-spacy-layout.git
   cd ocrpoc-spacy-layout
   ```

3. Set up the development environment:

   pre-commit install
   ```

5. Run tests to ensure everything works:

   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Branching Strategy

- `main`: Stable production code
- `feature/*`: New features (e.g., `feature/add-table-extraction`)
- `bugfix/*`: Bug fixes
- `hotfix/*`: Critical fixes for production

### Making Changes

1. Create a feature branch:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes following our coding standards

3. Write tests for new functionality

4. Run the full test suite:

   ```bash
   pytest --cov
   black .
   flake8
   bandit -r src/
   ```

5. Commit your changes:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add your feature description"
   ```

6. Push and create a pull request

### Commit Messages

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/):

- `feat:` New features
- `fix:` Bug fixes
- `docs:` Documentation changes
- `style:` Code style changes
- `refactor:` Code refactoring
- `test:` Test additions/modifications

## Coding Standards

### Python Style Guide

- Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) standards
- Use type hints for all function signatures
- Maximum line length: 88 characters (Black formatter)
- Use descriptive variable and function names

### Code Quality Tools

We use automated tools to maintain code quality:

- **Black**: Code formatting
- **Flake8**: Linting and style checking
- **Bandit**: Security vulnerability scanning
- **Pytest**: Testing framework with coverage reporting

### Testing

- Write unit tests for all new functionality
- Aim for 80%+ code coverage
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both success and failure scenarios
- Mock external dependencies when appropriate

### Documentation

- Add docstrings to all public functions and classes
- Update README.md for significant changes
- Include usage examples in docstrings
- Document any breaking changes

## Pull Request Process

1. **Create a PR**: Use the [pull request template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) and follow conventional commit format
2. **Description**: Fill out all sections of the PR template completely
3. **Labels**: Add appropriate labels (enhancement, bug, documentation, etc.)
4. **Review**: Request review from maintainers
5. **CI Checks**: Ensure all CI checks pass (tests, coverage, security scans)
6. **Merge**: Squash and merge after approval

### PR Template Usage

This project uses a comprehensive pull request template located at `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`. The template includes:
