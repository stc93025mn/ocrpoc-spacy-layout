# Security Considerations

## Data Privacy

- **Local Processing**: All PDF processing occurs locally; no documents are uploaded to external servers
- **No Data Persistence**: Processed results are stored locally unless explicitly configured otherwise
- **Input Validation**: Only PDF files are accepted; other file types are rejected

## Dependencies

- **Trusted Sources**: All dependencies are from reputable sources (spaCy, Docling, etc.)
- **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies updated to address security vulnerabilities
- **Virtual Environment**: Use isolated virtual environments to prevent dependency conflicts

## Network Security

- **HTTPS Downloads**: Sample PDFs are downloaded over HTTPS
- **No External APIs**: No external API calls except for PDF downloads in the POC
- **Firewall Considerations**: Ensure outbound HTTPS access for downloading samples

## Code Security

- **Input Sanitization**: File paths and URLs are validated
- **Error Handling**: Exceptions are caught and logged without exposing sensitive information
- **No Hardcoded Secrets**: No API keys or credentials in the codebase

## Operational Security

- **Access Control**: Limit access to the processing environment
- **Audit Logging**: Log processing activities for monitoring
- **Clean Up**: Remove temporary files and cached data after processing

## Compliance

- **Data Protection**: Ensure compliance with relevant data protection regulations
- **Retention Policies**: Define data retention periods for processed documents
- **Anonymization**: Remove or anonymize sensitive information from logs

## Known Limitations

- **PDF Vulnerabilities**: Malicious PDFs could potentially exploit parsing libraries
- **Memory Usage**: Large PDFs may consume significant memory
- **File Size Limits**: Implement size limits to prevent resource exhaustion

## Recommendations

1. Run in isolated environments
2. Implement rate limiting for API endpoints (if web-facing)
3. Use antivirus scanning for input files
4. Monitor for unusual processing patterns
5. Regular security audits of dependencies
